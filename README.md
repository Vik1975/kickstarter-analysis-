What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data? 
1.	Theater/plays is the most dominant category. At the same time the percent of succussed projects is quite similar for all categories and close to 50%. I would mention journalism as the most successful category with a 100% of Success. The similar tendency observed for all countries presented in a table,
2.	There were not any campaigns based on the data up to 2010 and after 2010 every year has the average about total 100 campaigns per year with a tremendous failure in 2020 (the result of COVID-2019 I believe).
3.	The most Successful campaigns were in a range between 15000 and 25000 and between 30000 and 35000. On the other hand the number most number of campaigns observed in a range between 1000 and 10000. 

What are some of the limitations of this dataset? 
	There is evidence that this sample does not fully represent the population of Kickstarter campaigns. For Example, not all countries are presented in a data. I would spread their variety to get more data. 
	There is not any information about other industries, such a banking, IT, medicine etc. that could affect on a full picture.
           It was not quite clear for me why some columns needed in a data (staff_pick, spotlight). Not very informative. 
	Lastly, the data set does not include the goal for the exact 50000 .
What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
	There are several tables/graphs we could create. Below is a list of some additional ideas for data displays:
1.	Table showing the most successful categories/subcategories vs the most unsuccessful categories/subcategories. 
2.	Table showing the median, mean , min, max for the goal vs pledged.
3.	Tables that exclude significant funding goal outliers.
